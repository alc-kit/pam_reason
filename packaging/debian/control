Description: PAM module to require and audit a login purpose
 This PAM module prompts interactive users for a written purpose for their
 login session, which is then audited via syslog.
 .
 It is designed to enhance security and accountability by ensuring that
 logins to sensitive systems are justified. The module can be configured
 to apply only to specific users or groups. Non-interactive sessions
 (e.g., Ansible, SCP) are automatically permitted to avoid breaking
 automation.
